# Container Training

This repository is a fork from jpetazzo/container.training. 
**Thanks for that!**

Its used as a basis for a docker training series at my school. 

Some changes are made to the dockercoins to fit you're special needs. 

## Build the Source

In order to build the source, python and python-flask need to be installed. 

On a linux system run the following commands: 

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
pip install Flask redis requests
```
